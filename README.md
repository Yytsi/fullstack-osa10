# About ESLint

In this module, the rules regarding ESLint were more flexible so I chose Prettier instead.
I think my Prettier config has everything from ESLint config + more good stuff.


# Important info regarding text fields
There is a known (unsolved!) mysterious bug which is documented here and there is not much I can do about it: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21911
